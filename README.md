# Web Crawler Scrapy Developed by Python

Web crawling to gather information is a common technique used to efficiently collect information from across the web. As an introduction to web crawling, in this project we will use Scrapy, a free and open source web crawling framework written in Python[1]. Originally designed for web scraping, it can also be used to extract data using APIs or as a general purpose web crawler. Even though Scrapy is a comprehensive infrastructure to support web crawling, you will face different kinds of challenges in real applications, e.g., dynamic JavaScript or your IP being blocked.

The project contains 3 parts. Each part is an extension of the previous one. The end goal is to code a Scrapy project that can crawl tens of thousands of apps from the Xiaomi AppStore, or any other app store with which you are familiar.
